            "\n",
            "After analyzing current market options, I recommend the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) as the best investment option for your situation. Here's why I'm recommending this over other alternatives:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Why VOO is Best for Your Situation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ultra-low expense ratio (0.03%)**: This is critical for someone with your income level, as fees can significantly impact returns. VOO charges only $0.30 annually per $1,000 invested, compared to many mutual funds that charge 10-20 times more.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lower share price accessibility**: VOO has a lower share price than comparable ETFs like iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), allowing you to invest smaller amounts more efficiently. This means you can start with less money and invest more frequently.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Dual-goal compatibility**: The S&P 500's historical performance makes it suitable for both your medium-term car purchase goal and your long-term retirement planning.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Diversification**: VOO instantly diversifies your investments across 500+ of America's largest companies spanning all major sectors of the economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Tax efficiency**: VOO has excellent tax efficiency, which helps maximize returns, especially important at your income level.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Comparison with Alternatives:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)**: While almost identical in performance and expense ratio to VOO, IVV typically has a higher share price, requiring more money to purchase a single share.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**: The oldest and most liquid S&P 500 ETF, but has a higher expense ratio (0.09%) compared to VOO's 0.03%, which would eat more into your returns over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Individual stocks**: Far too risky for your goals and income level, as poor performance from a few companies could significantly impact your savings.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Target-date funds**: While convenient for retirement planning, these typically have higher expense ratios and may be too conservative for your car purchase goal.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Set up a Roth IRA first**: Since your income is below the Roth IRA contribution limits, this is ideal. You can contribute up to $6,500 annually (2023 limit), and investments grow tax-free. You can withdraw your contributions (but not earnings) penalty-free at any time, which could help with your car purchase.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Create a \"bucket\" approach**:\n",
            "   - **Car purchase bucket**: Aim to keep about 30-40% of your investments more accessible for your car purchase goal.\n",
            "   - **Retirement bucket**: The remaining 60-70% should be dedicated to long-term retirement savings.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Start with small, consistent investments**: Even $50-100 monthly can build significantly over time. The power of compounding works best when you start early, which is an advantage at your age.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Consider fractional shares**: Many brokerages now offer fractional shares of ETFs, allowing you to invest specific dollar amounts rather than having to buy whole shares.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Keep emergency fund separate**: Since you already have an emergency fund, make sure to keep it in a high-yield savings account separate from your investments.\n",
